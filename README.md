##  Description 
This project presents a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Superstore Sales dataset using Python. The goal is to uncover patterns in sales performance, identify high-performing categories and regions, understand discount behavior, and generate actionable business insights. The analysis includes data cleaning, outlier removal, visualizations, and final recommendations.

- Office Supplies category has the highest number of sales transactions
- Technology category generates higher revenue per order despite fewer transactions
- West Region leads in total sales performance
- November–December show the highest sales peaks, indicating strong seasonality
- Moderate discounts help boost sales, but very high discounts reduce profitability
